My production app, which helps our team to compare two tables, show result what not to produce on printers, only to get from ready made pieces. CRUD app. 

Our emplyess everyday get from Magento system a csv file with work to do. They have to produce prints on fabrics for actual orders.
Some of this actual work was produced by mistake, or returned back from clients in the past. They have that good printed pieces at numered places in our company named Nr. Rega≈Çu. 
To not search it by hand one by one, I wrote this simple Crud app to help them find in a few seconds, that pieces which they should not produce, only take from this allready made good pieces.
They could add new good pieces, edit them, delete them, change places where they are.
